    [MOST EFFICIENT APPROACH FOR THIS PRORAM]

    An Efficient Solution can print all triplets in O(k) time where k is number of triplets printed. 
    The idea is to use square sum relation of Pythagorean triplet, i.e., addition of squares of a and 
    b is equal to square of c, we can write these number in terms of m and n such that,

       a = m2 - n2
       b = 2 * m * n
       c  = m2 + n2

because,
       a2 = m4 + n4 â€“ 2 * m2 * n2
       b2 = 4 * m2 * n2
       c2 = m4 + n4 + 2* m2 * n2
    We can see that a2 + b2 = c2, so instead of iterating for a, b and c we can iterate for m and n and 
    can generate these triplets.
